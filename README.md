Dockerized ownCloud CLI Client (owncloudcmd) to sync from any supported ownCloud or Nextcloud-like environment.  
This container should work with any ownCloud, Nextcloud, TransIP STACK or any other ownCloud/Nextcloud based storage endpoint.

I forked the original project to be able to run TransIP's STACK in a Docker.

The main use of this Docker is to be able to synchronise with a ownCloud or Nextcloud-like environment that is not part of the server that you run this Docker on.
Example usecase of this container is that you have a remote (ownCloud or Nextcloud) cloud storage somewhere, that you wish to have continously synced with your server that runs Docker. For example, the ownCloud/Nextcloud of a friend or a paid ownCloud/Nextcloud-like environment like TransIP STACK.

## Docker Features
* Base: Debian 10
* Latest ownCloud Client from the OpenSUSE repositories
* Size: <100MB
* **Ability to only sync only one folder**
* Created with [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) in mind
